Triose phosphate isomerase
glycolysis|1
catalyzes the reversible interconversion of the triose phosphate isomers dihydroxyacetone phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
EC 5.3.1.1

Phosphoglycerate kinase
glycolysis|2
catalyzes the reversible transfer of a phosphate group from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP producing 3-phosphoglycerate and ATP
EC 2.7.2.3

Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase
glycolysis|3
an enzyme in the family of carboxy-lyases found in plants and some bacteria that catalyzes the addition of bicarbonate (HCO3−) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form the four-carbon compound oxaloacetate and inorganic phosphate
EC 4.1.1.31

Pyruvate kinase
glycolysis|4,pentose phosphate|0
It catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate to adenosine diphosphate, yielding one molecule of pyruvate and one molecule of ATP.
EC 2.7.1.40

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
pentose phosphate|1,glycolysis|0
D-glucose 6-phosphate + NADP⁺ ⇌ 6-phospho-D-glucono-1,5-lactone + NADPH + H⁺
EC 1.1.1.49

Gluconolactonase
pentose phosphate|2
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. 
EC 3.1.1.17

6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase
pentose phosphate|3
It forms ribulose 5-phosphate from 6-phosphogluconate. It is an oxidative carboxylase that catalyses the decarboxylating reduction of 6-phosphogluconate into ribulose 5-phosphate in the presence of NADP
EC 1.1.1.44

Transaldolase
pentose phosphate|4
transaldolase:catalyzes the following reaction sedoheptulose 7-phosphate + glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate erythrose 4-phosphate + fructose 6-phosphate.
EC 2.2.1.2

Succinate dehydrogenase
TCA cycle|1
This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate with the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol
EC 1.3.5.1

Fumarase
TCA cycle|2
It catalyzes the reversible hydration/dehydration of fumarate to malate
EC 4.2.1.2

Malate dehydrogenase
TCA cycle|3,glycolysis|0
It reversibly catalyzes the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate using the reduction of NAD+ to NADH.
EC 1.1.1.37

Citrate synthase
TCA cycle|4
It catalyzes the condensation reaction of the two-carbon acetate residue from acetyl coenzyme A and a molecule of four-carbon oxaloacetate to form the six-carbon citrate
EC 2.3.3.1
